# billing_dept_project
The billing department project involves creating a formula that can identify individuals who are running out of the hours that have been approved by the state. This project aims to streamline the billing process by automatically flagging cases where individuals have exceeded their approved hours, allowing the billing department to take appropriate action to ensure accurate billing. By implementing this formula, the billing department can improve their efficiency and accuracy, leading to better financial management for the organization.
